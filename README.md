- `pnpm run rr` - Run the `run-run` CLI in development mode
- `pnpm run vland` - Run the `starter` CLI in development mode

If you have [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev) installed, you can use the following commands directly:

### Release

This monorepo uses [Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) to manage releases. The [Changesets bot](https://github.com/changesets/bot) is also installed in the repository.

**Preview Release**:

To preview changes in any package, create a pull request using the branch pattern `feat/*` or `fix/*`. This triggers a special GitHub workflow that publishes the package with the changes to the npm registry under the tag `pr-<PR_NUMBER>`. To preview your changes, install the package with the corresponding tag:

```bash
pnpm install @variableland/<package>@pr-123
```
