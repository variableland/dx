# biome-config

`@rrlab/biome-config` is the [Biome](https://biomejs.dev) preset of [run-run](https://github.com/withvariablelab/dx/tree/main/run-run/cli). The `biome.json` that [`@rrlab/biome-plugin`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rrlab/biome-plugin) writes extends it.

## Install

If you use run-run:

```sh
rr plugins add biome
```

Once you confirm, it installs this preset and writes a `biome.json` that extends it.

Without run-run, install it by hand:

```sh
pnpm add -D @rrlab/biome-config @biomejs/biome
```

Then create a `biome.json`:

```json
{
  "$schema": "./node_modules/@biomejs/biome/configuration_schema.json",
  "extends": ["@rrlab/biome-config"]
}
```

It needs Biome 2 or later: the preset's `$schema` URL is tied to a Biome major, and the rule set changes between majors.

## Configuration

Keys in your `biome.json` win over the preset. Add `linter.rules`, `formatter`, `files.includes` or any other setting as you need. To chain another shared config on top, append it to the `extends` array: later entries override earlier ones, so your preferences and local keys win over this base.
