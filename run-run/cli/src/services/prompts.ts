/**
 * Adapter that exposes the subset of `@clack/prompts` matching the
 * `ClackPrompts` contract from `@rrlab/cli/plugin`. The contract intentionally
 * stays narrow (`select`, `confirm`, `isCancel`) so plugin install hooks can
 * be tested by injecting a stub without pulling in the real terminal IO.
 *
 * The casts compensate for two small type-shape mismatches:
 * - Our contract requires `label: string`; clack types `label?: string`.
 * - `clack.select` returns `Promise<unknown>` (a non-cancelled value or
 *   `symbol`); our contract narrows that to `Promise<T | symbol>`.
 *
 * Both widenings are safe: every required field is present, and clack's
 * runtime returns either the picked option's `value` (typed `T`) or
 * `clack.isCancel(...)`-detectable `symbol`.
